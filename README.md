# A Python program demonstrating the representation of computer images as a scalar field

Traditionally computer images are represented as two dimensional arrays of pixels. An alternative approach is to represent images as functions defined over the 
real coordinate plane.

Something like:

```
Image = (Real, Real) -> Intensity
```
